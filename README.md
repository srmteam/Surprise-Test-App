Surprise Test is an application developed in order to facilitate the conduction of surprise tests for students in an easy, environment friendly manner. This helps us to avoid wastage of paper and also eliminate malpractice in exams.

Using this code and their registration number, students can login to the Surprise Test App. Facility is provided for auto correction of the test paper and the results can be viewed immediately after finishing the exam. The results are then organized and sent to the respective teacherâ€™s portal.
